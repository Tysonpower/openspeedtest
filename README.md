# Modern UI for openspeedtest

I really like using the HTML based Speedtest made by Openspeedtest.com especially on my local Network.
It works great, but i didn't like the UI really, it also isn't the Best on different Screen Sizes.

With that i build a new Modern UI from Scratch based on vite and Tailwindcss as well as some JS.
The new UI works great on all Screens and has a modern dark look to it.

I also talked to the Openspeedtest Developer and i hope that he will use this New UI in the Future for the Speedtest.
